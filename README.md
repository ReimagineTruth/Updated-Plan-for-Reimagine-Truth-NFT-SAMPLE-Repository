2. Key Updates to Implement:
A. Smart Contracts Update
TruthSeekersNFT.sol:
Update the ERC-721 contract to handle new card types, rarities, and attributes.
Add the ability to mint NFTs with different rarities (e.g., Common, Rare, Ultra Rare) and their respective prices.
Implement unique NFT types like "Owner Card" with custom benefits.
Include metadata fields for new attributes such as Level, Attack, Defense, Effect, Style Variant, and Price.
B. NFT Metadata Changes
Update NFT metadata files to include:
Rarity: Common, Rare, Ultra Rare, etc.
Type: Normal, Effect, Ritual, etc.
Attributes: Power, Style Variant, Level, Attack, Defense, and Effect.
Unique Cards: For example, the "Owner Card" should have exclusive benefits and a unique price.
C. Frontend Update
UI for NFT Cards:
Display NFTs with their updated attributes (Rarity, Level, Attack/Defense, Price, etc.).
Implement sorting and filtering by rarity and type for the marketplace.
Add a "Legendary Owner Card" feature that highlights its uniqueness and benefits.
D. Database Update
Card Database (card-database.json):
Add new NFTs and their respective metadata following the updated attributes and rarities.
Example entry for the "Reimagine Truth Owner Card":
json
Copy code
{
  "name": "Reimagine Truth Owner Card",
  "description": "This card represents the pinnacle of the Reimagine Truth project. Only one will ever be minted, and its owner will gain exclusive benefits, access to high-tier features, and full control over key decisions within the Reimagine Truth ecosystem.",
  "image": "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmExampleHash",
  "attributes": [
    { "trait_type": "Rarity", "value": "Legendary" },
    { "trait_type": "Price", "value": "1582.01 ETH" },
    { "trait_type": "Power", "value": "100" },
    { "trait_type": "Style Variant", "value": "Normal" },
    { "trait_type": "Level", "value": "100" },
    { "trait_type": "Attack", "value": "5000" },
    { "trait_type": "Defense", "value": "5000" },
    { "trait_type": "Effect", "value": "Exclusive control and access within Reimagine Truth ecosystem." },
    { "trait_type": "Type", "value": "Owner Card" }
  ]
}
E. Add NFT Rarity Explanation
New Document: Add an nft-rarities.md file explaining the different rarity levels and their benefits.
Example content:
markdown
Copy code
## Truth Seekers Deck Rarities

**Common**: Standard cards with basic attributes.

**Rare**: Cards with enhanced attributes and slight additional power.

**Ultra Rare**: High-quality cards with additional abilities or features.

**Secret Rare**: Rare cards with secret abilities and a high collector value.

**Mosaic Rare**: Cards with unique patterns and color effects.

**Shatterfoil Rare**: Cards that include a shiny, broken effect in the design.

**Rainbow Rare**: Cards with special rainbow-colored effects and extreme rarity.

**Owner Card (Legendary)**: Exclusive card that grants total control within the Reimagine Truth ecosystem. Only one exists and offers unique benefits.
F. Tokenomics Update
Updated Tokenomics:
Define how the $RTO token will interact with the NFTs, such as using $RTO for purchasing exclusive cards or staking for special benefits.
Revise the minting process to incorporate $RTO for card purchases or exclusive access.
3. Next Steps for Updating the Repository
A. Update Smart Contract Logic
Add the updated card attributes and features to the ERC-721 contract.
Deploy the contract to the blockchain (e.g., Optimism or Ethereum).
Update the staking contract to integrate with the new NFTs.
B. Update Frontend UI
Display all updated attributes and rarities on the frontend.
Create pages for each rarity with clear sorting and filters.
Update the homepage and marketplace to include the Legendary Owner Card.
C. Update Documentation
Revise README.md to reflect new features and functionality.
Update whitepaper.pdf with changes to tokenomics and the NFT rarity model.
Add a detailed guide on how to mint and buy NFTs using $RTO.
